DONE Delete animations
DONE Playback controls now work only when animation is saved. They should work before saving. I wanna know what I save.
Stop button should move playback cursor to the beginning of the animation. Figure should be in corresponding position after the click. 
When we just clicked new animation button the figure should be in some default state.
When we create new animation, the first keyframe should be added by default with default sliders position and at 0 time.
Play button should resume playback from moment that was paused byu pause button.
